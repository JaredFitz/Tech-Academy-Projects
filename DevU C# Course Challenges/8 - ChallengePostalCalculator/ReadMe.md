Postal Calculator

See Mockup for design of the application.

Business Rule 1: Accept width, height and optionally the length of a parcel.  Accept the shipping method - Ground, Air, Next Day.

Business Rule 2: Once you have the minimum amount of information you need, produce a result on screen.  The result will be the volume of the package (width * height and optionally * length) multiplied by the "multiplier" for each shipping method.

Ground: .15 multiplier
Air: .25 multiplier
Next Day: .45

Non-Functional Requirement 1: You must name the project ChallengePostalCalculatorHelperMethods.
