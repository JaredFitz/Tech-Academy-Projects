1. Create a List of Courses (add three example Courses ...make up the details).  Each Course should have at least twoStudents enrolled in them.  Use Object and CollectionInitializers.  Then, iterate through each Course and print out the Course's details and the Students that are enrolled in each Course. (use foreach course and foreach student)

2. Create a Dictionary of Students (add three example Students... make up the details).  Use the StudentId as the key.  Each student must be enrolled in two Courses.  Use Object and Collection Initializers.  Then, iterate through each student and print out to the web page each Student's info and the Courses the Student is enrolled in.

3. We need to keep track of each Student's grade (0 to 100) in a particular Course.  This means at a minimum, you'll need to add another class, and depending on your implementation, you will probably need to modify the existing classes to accommodate this new requirement.  Give each Student a grade in each Course they are enrolled in (make up the data).  Then, for each student, print out each Course they are enrolled in and their grade.
