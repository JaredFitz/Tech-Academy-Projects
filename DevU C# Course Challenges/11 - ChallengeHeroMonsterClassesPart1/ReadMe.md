REQUIREMENTS
=============

1. Name the project: ChallengeHeroMonsterClassesPart1

2. Create a Character class
It should have properties:
Name
Health
DamageMaximum
AttackBonus

3. The Character class should have two methods:

Attack() return an int - randomly determine the amount of damage this Character object inflicted.
((use the Random class))

Defend(int damage) - deducts the damage from this Character's health

4.  In the Page_Load() create two instances of the Character class: 

hero
monster

... and set their attributes (to whatever you want)

5.  You will perform two sides of the battle.  The first half of the battle will involve the hero attacking the monster and the monster defending itself.  The second half of the battle will involve the monster attacking and the hero defending itself.  Just one round -- this is not a fight to the death.

6.  Create a helper method in the Deafult class to display the stats of each character in a Label server control.
